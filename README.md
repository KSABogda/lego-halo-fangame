**Running from source**  
First [obtain a recent build of UPBGE](https://download.upbge.org/)

Then clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pqftgs/lego-halo-fangame.git
cd lego-halo-fangame
```

And finally download submodule(s):
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To play: Open Game.blend (or a level directly from the scenes folder) and press "P" with the mouse in the 3D view.

**Multiplayer**  
Player 2 can drop in with a controller by pressing start.  Due to engine limitations the controller has to be plugged in before launching the game.

Online multiplayer does exist but is currently limited in functionality.
